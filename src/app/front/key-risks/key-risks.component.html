          Investing in real estate through JustStake (“we,” “us,” “our”) offers
          unique opportunities but also carries inherent risks. This document
          outlines the key risks associated with investing through our Platform.
          By proceeding with any investment, you acknowledge that you have read,
          understood, and accepted these risks.
        </p>
        <h2>1. General Investment Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Risk of Loss</h3>
        <p>
          All investments carry the risk of partial or complete loss of the
          invested amount. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
          returns.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Market Volatility</h3>
        <p>
          Real estate values may fluctuate due to changes in market conditions,
          demand, interest rates, or macroeconomic factors, which could impact
          the performance of your investment.
        </p>
        <h3>c. Liquidity Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Real estate is inherently illiquid. Although we offer bi-annual exit
          windows and secondary market opportunities, the ability to sell your
          investment is not guaranteed and may be subject to delays or reduced
          valuation.
        </p>
        <h3>d. Economic and Political Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Changes in economic policies, political instability, inflation,
          currency fluctuations, or regulatory changes in the regions where the
          properties are located could negatively affect your investment.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Real Estate-Specific Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Property Value Decline</h3>
        <p>
          The value of real estate properties may decline due to market
          saturation, declining demand, or neighborhood deterioration.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Rental Income Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Rental income may fluctuate or cease due to tenant defaults,
          vacancies, changes in rental demand, or legal restrictions.
        </p>
        <h3>c. Development Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Investments in development projects are subject to risks such as
          construction delays, cost overruns, and unforeseen complications.
        </p>
        <h3>d. Geographic Concentration</h3>
        <p>
          If your portfolio is concentrated in a specific location, it may be
          more vulnerable to local market downturns, natural disasters, or
          regulatory changes.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Regulatory and Compliance Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Legal and Regulatory Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Changes in laws or regulations governing real estate investments,
          taxes, or property ownership in the jurisdictions we operate in may
          adversely affect your investment.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Foreign Ownership Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions may impose restrictions on foreign ownership of
          real estate, which could impact your rights as an investor.
        </p>
        <h3>c. Compliance with Local Laws</h3>
        <p>
          Investments are subject to local laws and regulations, and
          non-compliance could result in penalties, fines, or loss of property
          rights.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Operational Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Management Risk</h3>
        <p>
          The performance of your investment may depend on the effectiveness of
          property management services. Poor management can negatively impact
          rental income and property value.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Platform Risks</h3>
        <p>
          The operation of our Platform is subject to technological risks,
          including system outages, cyberattacks, and data breaches, which could
          impact your access to information or funds.
        </p>
        <h3>c. Reliance on Third Parties</h3>
        <p>
          We rely on third-party service providers for property sourcing,
          valuation, management, and other services. Failures or delays by these
          parties may adversely affect your investment.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Financial Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Interest Rate Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Changes in interest rates may affect the cost of financing for
          properties, impacting profitability and overall returns.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Currency Risk</h3>
        <p>
          For investors investing in properties located in foreign markets,
          currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect returns when
          converted back to your local currency.
        </p>
        <h3>c. Fee Structures</h3>
        <p>
          Management fees, performance fees, and other charges may reduce the
          net returns of your investment.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Tax Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Tax Liability</h3>
        <p>
          Investors are responsible for understanding and complying with the tax
          laws in their country of residence as well as the country where the
          property is located. Tax treatment may change over time.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Withholding Taxes</h3>
        <p>
          Investments in certain jurisdictions may be subject to withholding
          taxes on rental income or capital gains, which could impact net
          returns.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Environmental and Natural Disaster Risks</h2>
        <h3>a. Natural Disasters</h3>
        <p>
          Properties may be at risk of damage or destruction due to natural
          disasters such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes. Insurance may
          not fully cover all losses.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Environmental Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Properties may require remediation or compliance with environmental
          regulations, resulting in additional costs and potential fines.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Fraud and Misrepresentation Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Although we conduct due diligence on all investment opportunities,
          there is a risk of fraud, misrepresentation, or inaccurate property
          valuations by sellers or third-party providers.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Risk of Changes to JustStake’s Business Model</h2>
        <p>
          Changes to our business model, operations, or services, including
          termination of the Platform, could impact the management and
          performance of your investments.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Investor Responsibility</h2>
        <h3>a. Due Diligence</h3>
        <p>
          Investors are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence and seek
          independent financial, legal, or tax advice before making any
          investment.
        </p>
        <h3>b. Diversification</h3>
        <p>
          Investors should consider diversifying their investments to mitigate
          risks associated with concentration in a single property, market, or
          asset class.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>

          our Platform, you acknowledge that you are investing at your own risk
